"Hi! I'm excited to show you the Women's Health AI Assistant - a full-stack application I built to help women track their menstrual cycle and get personalized health tips powered by AI."

## Tech Stack (10 seconds)
"This app uses React with Vite and Tailwind CSS for a beautiful, responsive frontend, and Express.js with Groq AI for the backend. The entire UI dynamically changes based on the user's current menstrual cycle phase."

## Key Features (25 seconds)
"The app has three main features:
1. **Phase Selection** - Users can select from four cycle phases: menstrual, follicular, ovulation, and luteal. Each phase has its own color theme and icon.
2. **Daily Wellness Quotes** - AI generates personalized, uplifting quotes tailored to the current cycle phase. Every quote is unique thanks to advanced prompt engineering.
3. **Symptom Tracker** - Users can enter symptoms or select from common ones like cramps or fatigue, and get AI-powered health tips that consider both the symptom and their current cycle phase."

## Technical Highlights (10 seconds)
"I implemented sophisticated prompt engineering to ensure every AI response is unique, with randomized styles, formats, and context. The backend uses Groq's free API with high temperature settings for maximum creativity."
